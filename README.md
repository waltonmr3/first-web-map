Title: my first web map 

This map holds 4 points. 2 are the start and end points and 2 are points of interest. They are interactive as their titles pop up when interacted with. It is complied of a basemap and a route set on top with the previously mentioned four points. In addition, the map has a description written to help the user navigate the map. It walks through the significance and meaning of the various points.

In addition to the paragraph description, there is a link to one of the views that can be found along this route. 
I used Google Maps as my data source, mapping out the route and then collecting those coordinates and using the maps to GPX software to convert this data into my .js file.
